# Disaster Recovery with IBM Cloud Virtual Servers
## Phase 3: Development Part 1

A disaster recovery strategy is a comprehensive plan that outlines the steps and procedures an organization will take to recover from a disruptive event, such as a natural disaster, cyberattack, or power outage. The goal of a disaster recovery strategy is to minimize the downtime and impact on the organization's operations and to restore critical systems and data as quickly as possible.

A disaster recovery strategy should be tailored to the specific needs of the organization and should take into account the following factors:

- The types of disasters that the organization is most likely to face
- The critical systems and data that need to be recovered
- The acceptable amount of downtime
- The financial resources available for disaster recovery

## Risk Assessment

The first step in developing a disaster recovery strategy is to conduct a risk assessment. This involves identifying the threats and vulnerabilities that the organization faces and assessing the likelihood and impact of different types of disasters. The risk assessment should consider both natural and man-made disasters, such as:

- Natural disasters: floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, wildfires, etc.
- Man-made disasters: cyberattacks, power outages, hardware failures, software failures, human error, etc.

## Business Impact Analysis

Once the risk assessment is complete, the next step is to conduct a business impact analysis (BIA). This involves identifying and prioritizing the organization's critical systems and data and determining the impact of a disruption to these systems. The BIA should consider the following factors:

- The impact on customer service
- The impact on employee productivity
- The impact on compliance with regulations

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The RTO is the maximum amount of time that the organization can afford to be without access to its critical systems and data. The RTO will vary depending on the organization's industry and specific needs. For example, an e-commerce company may have a very low RTO, as even a brief outage can result in lost sales.

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The RPO is the maximum amount of data that the organization can afford to lose in the event of a disaster. The RPO will also vary depending on the organization's industry and specific needs. For example, a financial services company may have a very low RPO, as even a small amount of data loss could have serious consequences.

The specific RTO for disaster recovery can vary significantly from one organization to another, depending on the nature of the business, its IT infrastructure, and its tolerance for downtime. Some critical systems may have very short RTOs, meaning they must be recovered quickly, often within minutes, to minimize business impact. Others may have longer RTOs, allowing for a more extended recovery period.

## Disaster Recovery Procedures

Disaster recovery procedures are a critical part of an organization's business continuity planning. These procedures outline the steps and actions that need to be taken to recover and restore critical systems and operations in the event of a disaster or major disruption. Here are some key components and steps involved in disaster recovery procedures:

### 1. Risk Assessment and Planning:

- Identify potential risks and threats that could lead to a disaster, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, hardware failures, or human errors.
- Assess the impact of these risks on the organization, including potential downtime, data loss, and financial consequences.
- Develop a disaster recovery plan that outlines the procedures for responding to these risks.

### 2. Business Impact Analysis:

- Identify critical systems, processes, and data that are essential for business operations.
- Determine the Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) for each critical component. RTO specifies how quickly each system should be recovered, and RPO defines the acceptable data loss.

### 3. Backup and Data Recovery:

- Establish regular backup processes to ensure data is securely and regularly backed up. This includes both on-site and off-site backups.
- Test data restoration procedures to ensure that data can be recovered as needed.

### 4. Redundancy and Failover Systems:

- Implement redundancy and failover systems for critical applications and infrastructure to reduce downtime. This might involve hot/cold standby systems or clustering.
- Regularly test these systems to ensure they function as expected.

### 5. Incident Response:

- Develop an incident response plan that includes immediate actions to take when a disaster is detected, such as notifying key personnel, isolating affected systems, and preserving data.

### 6. Communication and Notification:

- Establish a communication plan to notify employees, customers, and other stakeholders about the disaster and the organization's response.
- Ensure that contact information for key personnel and third-party service providers is up-to-date.

### 7. Recovery Team and Responsibilities:

- Assign roles and responsibilities to a disaster recovery team, including a leader and specific task assignments.
- Ensure that team members are trained and understand their roles.

### 8. Recovery Procedures:

- Document detailed procedures for recovering critical systems, applications, and data.
- Ensure that these procedures are accessible and understandable by recovery team members.

### 9. Testing and Drills:

- Conduct regular disaster recovery tests and drills to validate the effectiveness of the procedures and the team's response.
- Document the results and make improvements as necessary.

### 10. Documentation and Reporting:

- Maintain thorough documentation of all disaster recovery activities, including incident reports, test results, and recovery logs.
- Report on disaster recovery activities to management and stakeholders.

## Testing and Maintenance

The disaster recovery strategy should be tested regularly to ensure that it is effective. This testing should include both tabletop exercises and full-scale simulations. The strategy should also be updated regularly to reflect changes in the organization's environment and to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

## Communication

It is important to communicate the disaster recovery strategy to all employees and make sure they know their roles and responsibilities in the event of a disaster. This communication should be done in a clear and concise manner and should be easy to understand for employees of all levels.

By following these steps, organizations can develop a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy that will help them to recover from a disruptive event with minimal downtime and impact on their operations.

## RTO

RTO in disaster recovery stands for Recovery Time Objective. It is the maximum amount of time that an organization can afford to be without access to its critical systems and data after a disaster. The RTO is typically set in hours or minutes, and it is important to choose a realistic RTO that is achievable given the organization's resources and budget.

The RTO is one of the key factors in developing a disaster recovery plan. It is important to consider the RTO when choosing disaster recovery technologies and procedures.

Here are some tips for reducing the RTO:

- Implement a data protection plan that includes regular backups and disaster recovery testing.
- Use a cloud-based disaster recovery solution. Cloud-based disaster recovery solutions can provide a quick and easy way to recover systems and data in the event of a disaster.
- Have a well-defined disaster recovery plan and communicate it to all employees. The plan should outline the steps that will be taken to recover systems and data after a disaster and should be communicated to all employees so that they know what to expect.

By following these tips, organizations can reduce their RTO and minimize the impact of a disaster on their operations.

Here are some examples of RTOs for different types of organizations:

- Financial services: Minutes or hours
- Healthcare: Minutes or hours
- Retail: Hours or days
- Manufacturing: Hours or days
- Government: Days or weeks

The RTO for a particular organization will depend on its specific needs and industry. For example, a financial services company may have a very short RTO because it cannot afford to be without access to its trading systems for even a few hours. On the other hand, a manufacturing company may have a longer RTO because it may be able to continue operating without its production systems for a few days.

It is important to note that the RTO is just one factor in developing a disaster recovery plan. Organizations should also consider other factors, such as the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and the financial impact of a disaster.

## RPO

Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) for disaster recovery are a critical component of an organization's overall disaster recovery and data protection strategy. RPOs specify the maximum allowable data loss an organization can tolerate in the event of a disaster or major disruption. Here are some key considerations for defining RPOs in a disaster recovery context:

1. Data Criticality: Identify and prioritize data and systems based on their criticality to the organization. This involves assessing the impact of data loss on business operations and evaluating which data and systems are essential for the organization to function.

2. Timeframes: Specify RPOs in terms of time units, such as minutes, hours, or days, depending on the nature of the data and its importance to the business. Critical data may have very low RPOs, while less critical data may have longer RPOs.

3. Data Types: Different types of data may have different RPOs. For example, customer transaction data in an e-commerce system might have a very low RPO, while historical archives or non-essential data may have longer RPOs.

4. Data Protection Mechanisms:

   - Implement data protection mechanisms like regular backups, replication, or continuous data synchronization to achieve the defined RPOs.
   - Consider the appropriate technology and solutions based on the RPO requirements. For example, real-time data replication can help achieve very low RPOs.

5. Frequency of Backups: The frequency of data backups should align with the established RPOs. For example, if the RPO is one hour, data should be backed up at least once every hour.

6. Testing and Validation: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure they can meet the specified RPOs. Testing helps identify any issues that may prevent the organization from achieving its data recovery goals.

7. Documentation and Communication: Clearly document the RPOs for each system, process, or data type and communicate them to relevant stakeholders, including IT staff, management, and disaster recovery teams.

8. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that RPOs align with any industry regulations, legal requirements, or service level agreements (SLAs) that pertain to data protection and recovery.

9. Flexibility and Adaptation: RPOs may need to be reviewed and adjusted periodically to account for changes in data volume, technology, business processes, or regulatory requirements.

10. Risk Assessment: Assess potential disaster scenarios and the impact of data loss to validate and adjust RPOs accordingly.

By clearly defining RPOs for disaster recovery, organizations can effectively plan for data protection and recovery to minimize data loss during disasters or disruptions. It helps ensure that data can be restored to a point in time that aligns with the organization's operational needs and risk tolerance.

By following these tips, organizations can reduce their RPO and minimize the impact of a disaster on their operations.

Here are some examples of RPOs for different types of organizations:

- Financial services: Minutes or hours
- Healthcare: Minutes or hours
- Retail: Hours or days
- Manufacturing: Hours or days
- Government: Days or weeks

The RPO for a particular organization will depend on its specific needs and industry. For example, a financial services company may have a very short RPO because it cannot afford to lose even a few minutes of data. On the other hand, a manufacturing company may have a longer RPO because it may be able to continue operating without its production data for a few days.

It is important to note that the RPO is just one factor in developing a disaster recovery plan. Organizations should also consider other factors, such as the RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and the financial impact of a disaster.

The RPO and RTO are two of the most important factors in disaster recovery planning. By carefully considering these two factors, organizations can develop a disaster recovery plan that will help them to minimize the impact of a disaster and get back to business as quickly as possible.

## Priority of Virtual Machines

In disaster recovery planning, prioritizing virtual machines (VMs) is crucial to ensure the most critical systems and services are recovered first in the event of a disaster. This priority can help minimize downtime and data loss, allowing an organization to maintain essential operations. Here's a general guideline for prioritizing virtual machines in disaster recovery:

1. Identify Critical Business Processes: Start by identifying the critical business processes or functions that rely on VMs. These processes are fundamental to the organization's operations and may include customer-facing services, financial transactions, and essential internal communication and collaboration tools.

2. Categorize VMs: Categorize VMs based on their importance to these critical business processes. Consider factors such as data dependency, customer impact, and regulatory requirements. VMs can typically be divided into three categories:

3. Determine Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs): Define specific RTOs and RPOs for each VM category. RTO specifies how quickly each category of VM should be recovered, and RPO defines the acceptable data loss for each category.

4. Implement Redundancy and Failover: For Tier 1 VMs, consider implementing high-availability and failover solutions to ensure minimal downtime. This may include clustering, load balancing, or real-time replication. Tier 2 VMs can have less immediate failover capability, and Tier 3 VMs might rely on regular backups and recovery procedures.

5. Testing and Validation: Regularly test disaster recovery procedures for all VM categories to ensure that they align with the established RTOs and RPOs. Testing helps identify any issues that need to be addressed.

6. Documentation and Communication: Document the recovery priorities, RTOs, and RPOs for each VM category and communicate this information to the disaster recovery team, IT staff, and relevant stakeholders. Clear communication is essential in a crisis.

7. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that the prioritization and disaster recovery plans align with any regulatory compliance requirements specific to your industry.

8. Adaptation and Review: Periodically review and adapt your disaster recovery priorities based on changes in the business environment, technology, or the organization's risk profile.

Remember that while prioritization is essential, it's also important to have comprehensive disaster recovery plans in place for all VMs, even those with lower priorities. A well-rounded disaster recovery strategy ensures that the organization can recover from a disaster while addressing both immediate priorities and long-term continuity needs.
